# Release Notes for Ghostwriter

## 1.0.0 - Unreleased

First release. Ghostwriter learns how your site writes and what its pictures look like, then drafts new entries and edits existing ones in that voice, in a panel beside the entry form. Get started walks through setup, the Overview shows what is in progress, and a widget sits on Craft's dashboard.

### Writing
- **Write with Ghostwriter** on a section's new entries, beside **New entry** on the entry index, and from the Overview, the widget and the content plan.
- Choose a kind you taught it, something like what is already here, or a general brief that works on every section with no setup.
- The brief: answer its questions, or give a working title and notes and have it fill them in. **Model it on** up to six entries.
- A follow-up conversation: Ghostwriter asks at most three questions when it needs facts only you know, then takes changes in plain words. It never invents figures, quotes or client names.
- The draft in **Blocks** and **Text** views. Click any writing (or Tab to it) to change it in place; **Edit YAML** for the whole draft.
- **Use this draft** writes into the entry's Craft draft, to check and save. Nothing is saved or published for you.
- **Edit with Ghostwriter** on an existing entry changes its writing in conversation, into your provisional draft, keeping images, relations, links and settings.
- Plain text, CKEditor and Redactor fields, Matrix and Neo page builders, and Tables.

### Learning the site
- **Voice guide**, written from your published entries, edited by hand or by asking for a change.
- **Image style guide**, written from the images your entries use, one part per section.
- **Kinds of content**: suggested per section with examples and why each is worth teaching, learned on request, or taught by hand with their own questions, guidance, checklist and examples.
- Everything is kept in the database, so it works on read-only and load-balanced hosts.

### House style
- New entries copy what your entries agree on: block order, settings, links and heading markup. Links Ghostwriter can't decide point to `https://example.com` and are listed for you to set.

### Images
- A Ghostwriter button on Assets fields: **Find a photo** on Openverse, Unsplash, Pexels and Pixabay, ranked by the model against the page's words and the images already in that place, with a second round of searches when nothing fits.
- Found photos are named and titled from the library's description, which also fills Craft's own alt text, with the credit kept in a credit field where the volume has one.
- **Make the picture** with OpenAI or Gemini, in the style of the images already there, optionally with your own image in it.
- Photos offered for every image field under a draft, and striped placeholders where a new entry is still missing an image (**Mark images still to choose**).

### Content plan
- Ideas for entries each section is missing, reviewed before they join the plan, optionally steered. **Draft this** opens a new entry with the brief filled in.

### Teams
- Conversations are shared with everyone who may use Ghostwriter, showing who sent each message and who started and last changed each piece. Turn this off with **Share conversations** (`sharedConversations`).
- One permission, **Use Ghostwriter**. Writing into an entry still needs Craft's own permission to save it. Admins manage Ghostwriter.

### Providers
- Writing with Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Google (Gemini); images with OpenAI or Gemini. Defaults: `claude-opus-5-5`, `gpt-6.1-sol` and `gemini-3.8-flash` for writing; `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst` and `gemini-3.1-flash-image` for images.
- Keys are read from `.env` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) and never stored or shown.
- `baseUrls` for a gateway or proxy that speaks a provider's own API.
- A busy or rate-limited provider is tried again, up to three attempts in all, following its `retry-after`.
- A reply cut off at its length limit is asked for once more with twice the room; a draft or the voice guide is never saved half-written.
- Each call is logged to Craft's log with the provider, model, tokens and time, never the words.

### Requirements
- PHP 8.2 or later; Craft CMS 5.6 or later.
- An API key for Anthropic, OpenAI or Gemini.
- Craft's queue, which runs by itself from the control panel unless your site uses a worker.
